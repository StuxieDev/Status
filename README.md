# Status

### *Live status of StuxieDev's websites and projects, powered by [GitHup](https://githup.stux.group).*

**Status page:** [status.stuxie.dev](https://status.stuxie.dev)

<!-- A live badge: reads the overall status straight from data/summary.json. -->

## Current status

Updated by GitHup whenever the status page is rebuilt (hourly, and when a status changes).

## What's monitored

Every 5 minutes (when GitHub runs the schedule late, a run checks up to 4 times, 5 minutes apart, to fill the gap), GitHup checks each monitor in [`.githup.yml`](.githup.yml):

- **StuxieDev** and the **StuxieDev media CDN**, at the top of the page
- **Projects:** the projects hub (projects.stuxie.dev), TIGHC, TS4RLS and TWRAR
- **StuxieDev Archives:** archives.stuxie.dev and archives.stuxiedev.com
- **Related:** links to [RoboStux](https://robo.st) and [its own status page](https://status.robo.st). They are plain links, not monitored here, and are left out of the table above

To add a site, add a monitor to the right group there (or a new group). A group can also hold `links:` instead of monitors, for sites that should be listed but not checked.

When a site goes down, GitHup opens an Issue on this repository (labelled `githup`,
`incident`, `status` and the monitor's slug) and closes it with the downtime when it recovers.
To announce planned maintenance, open an Issue yourself with the `githup` and `incident` labels
(plus the monitor's slug to link it); it shows on the status page.

## How it works

- **`.github/workflows/status.yml`** runs a GitHup `check` every 5 minutes (with `fill-gaps`, up to 4 checks when the schedule is late) and commits the
  results to `data/` as `github-actions[bot]`. When a status changes, hourly, and on pushes, it
  builds the GitHup status page into `_site` (with `site-dir`), and deploys it with `actions/deploy-pages`.
- **`legal:` in `.githup.yml`** makes GitHup generate the **Boring Legal Stuff** hub at `/legal/`
  with its six sub-pages, a themed `404.html`, a `/sitemap/` page, `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`
  (the base URL is `site.url`). Nothing is hand-made, and the footer shows only
  **Powered by GitHup**. This repo's own `CHANGELOG.md` and `VERSION.md` are for this repo only.
- **`data/`** is the monitoring history, created by the first check. Don't edit it by hand.
- **The status table above** is written by GitHup's `readme` mode between the
  `<!-- githup:start -->` and `<!-- githup:end -->` markers. Don't edit inside them.

## Local development

```bash
./dev-server.sh                 # or dev-server.bat on Windows; add a port as the last argument
./dev-server.sh --no-dev-mode   # production rendering
```

`dev-server` generates 90 days of example data, builds the status page into `.dev/public` with
`DEV_MODE` on, with its legal pages, 404 and sitemap, and serves it at
`http://127.0.0.1:8000`. It uses GitHup from `$GITHUP_PATH`, a sibling `../GitHup` checkout, or
a fresh clone in `.dev/GitHup`.

## Hosting

GitHub Pages, deployed by Actions (**Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**), with the custom
domain `status.stuxie.dev` set in the Pages settings. DNS: a `CNAME` record for `status` pointing
at `stuxiedev.github.io`. The repository is public, so the page's live refresh can read
`data/summary.json` straight from GitHub.
